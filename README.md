These are my solutions to the five projects from CSC_103: Data Structures with Professor Soule at Monroe Community College. 

Project 1: DoubleArraySeq class
   this class simulates the Java ArrayList class. It allows for the creation of DoubleArraySeq objects that behave like arrays of double
   values with much added functionality through a series of methods. 
   
Project 2: UnboundedInt class
   uses linked lists to perform arithmetic with arbitrairly large integers (values can exceed a computer's 32 bits allocated to an integer)

project 3: N-queens
   uses stacks to solve the n-queens problem (how many configurations, and a list of each) for a user-specified chess board size.

Project 4: Golfer Scores database: 
   uses binary search trees to construct a database of golfer objects (scores, names, rounds played) and provides the user with a menu
   to interact with the data (perform additions / removals / listings / updates of entries, etc).

Project 5: Analysis of hashing techniques
   constructed two hash table classes (TableDoubeHash) and (TableChainHash) based on Michael Main's Table class. Driver program performs
   an analysis of the frequency of collisions for each of these methods of hashing. The main method reads data in from a file and puts it in
   three tables with different hashing methods: linear probing (open address hashing), double hashing, and chain hashing.
